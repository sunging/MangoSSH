 * Immutable snapshot of complete terminal state.
 *
 * This data class provides a point-in-time view of the entire terminal state,
 * including all visible lines, scrollback buffer, cursor state, and terminal
 * properties. It is designed to be transferred efficiently via StateFlow from
 * a background Service to the UI layer.
 *
 * Note: This class is not Parcelable because it contains non-Parcelable types
 * (TerminalLine with Compose Color). For cross-process communication, use
 * StateFlow which doesn't require Parcelable.
 *
 * @property lines The current visible screen lines (rows × cols)
 * @property scrollback Historical lines that have scrolled off the top
 * @property cursorRow Current cursor row position (0-based)
 * @property cursorCol Current cursor column position (0-based)
 * @property cursorVisible Whether the cursor is currently visible
 * @property cursorShape The shape of the cursor (block, underline, or bar)
 * @property terminalTitle The terminal window title (set by escape sequences)
 * @property rows Number of rows in the visible terminal
 * @property cols Number of columns in the visible terminal
 * @property timestamp Timestamp when this snapshot was created (System.currentTimeMillis())
 * @property sequenceNumber Monotonically increasing sequence number for ordering snapshots
